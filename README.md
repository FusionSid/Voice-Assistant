# Voice-Assistant
A Simple Voice assistant AI

## What is this
This is a very simple voice assistant. It uses speech recognition and then uses tts to give you an answer

It uses a python module call neuralintents which makes the code way shorter. 
Modules needed:
neuralintents
speechrecognition
pyttsx3
Rest should already be installed

When you run it, give it a couple second to load. Then type either t to train the model or s to use a pre-made model.
